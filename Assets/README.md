## Description
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to my daily planner, single use for that day so that I can manage my time effectively. This is a web based tool at this time. 


## Installation
No installtion needed, at this time


## Usage
Once the page is loaded you will just click in the time block you'd like to change, type what you'd like put in there, and click the save button on the right of that specific time block. There will be an alert button that comes up once properly saved. 


## Challenges

1. Getting the time blocks to show the approrpriate time
2. Getting the items stored to local storage
3. Getting the items to retrieve upon loading the page

## Test
interface testing as needed

Consistent testing throughout each iteration prior to deployment.
